# zfstop

A terminal-based dashboard for the Zettabyte File System, in the spirit of `htop`.

## Status

**v0.1 — proof of concept.** Right now zfstop does exactly one thing: it shows you, live, how much memory your ARC is using and what's inside it. That's it. No pools view, no datasets, no snapshots, no SMART. Those are coming in later versions.

The reason zfstop exists is that the existing tools each give you one slice of the picture — `zpool status`, `arc_summary`, `zfs list`, `smartctl` — and you end up running four commands and holding the whole thing in your head. zfstop is the dashboard that fuses them. v0.1 is the first slice.

## What v0.1 shows

A single screen that refreshes once a second:

- **ARC size** — current size against `c_max`, as a bar, so you can see at a glance whether the ARC is near its ceiling.
- **Breakdown** — MFU data, MRU data, metadata, and other, both in bytes and as a percentage of the total.
- **Hit ratio** — overall, demand, and prefetch.
- **Throughput** — hits and misses per second.

All of it comes from `/proc/spl/kstat/zfs/arcstats`. No subprocesses, no parsing of human-formatted output, no surprises.

## Install

### Arch Linux (AUR)

```
yay -S zfstop
```

Or with any AUR helper. The package installs the binary as `zfstop`.

### From source

```
git clone https://git.skylantix.com/rbitton/zfstop.git
cd zfstop
cargo build --release
sudo install -Dm755 target/release/zfstop /usr/bin/zfstop
```

### Prebuilt binary

Static musl binaries are attached to every [release](https://git.skylantix.com/rbitton/zfstop/-/releases):

- `zfstop-linux-amd64` — x86_64
- `zfstop-linux-arm64` — aarch64 (Graviton, Ampere Altra, Pi 4/5)

Download the one for your arch, then:

```
chmod +x zfstop-linux-amd64
sudo mv zfstop-linux-amd64 /usr/bin/zfstop
```

## Usage

```
zfstop                    # default: poll every 1s
zfstop -n 500             # poll every 500ms
zfstop --interval 2000    # poll every 2 seconds
zfstop --help             # show all options
```

## Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `q` / `Ctrl+C` | quit |
| `r` | force refresh |

That's the whole interface in v0.1.

## Requirements

- Linux with OpenZFS installed (the `/proc/spl/kstat/zfs/arcstats` file must exist)
- A terminal that supports ANSI colors and box-drawing characters, which is to say any terminal made in the last 30 years

No runtime dependencies beyond the kernel module being loaded. zfstop is a single static binary.

## Roadmap

zfstop is a *finishable* project. ZFS is stable, the surface area we care about isn't growing, and once the dashboard shows everything worth seeing there's no v3.0 plugin system to chase. The plan is to ship a few focused versions and then stop.

- **v0.1** — ARC memory visualization (this release)
- **v0.2** — pools view: capacity, fragmentation, health, vdev tree, scrub status
- **v0.3** — datasets view: usage, compression ratios, sortable and filterable
- **v0.4** — snapshots view, with awareness of Sanoid retention classes
- **v0.5** — SMART health joined to vdev members on the pools view
- **v1.0** — Remote/Fleet mode — use ssh either independently or with Ansible to monitor many machines at once.

## Why Rust

Because I wanted to see Rust in action on a project I deeply understand. Practically: a static musl binary with no runtime dependencies is the right shape for a system tool that lives on every host you manage, and Rust + ratatui is the cleanest path to that. If this had been Python with Textual it would've been faster to write and harder to ship.
