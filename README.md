# ztop

A terminal dashboard for ZFS, in the spirit of `htop`.

## Status

**v0.1 — proof of concept.** Right now ztop does exactly one thing: it shows you, live, how much memory your ARC is using and what's inside it. That's it. No pools view, no datasets, no snapshots, no SMART. Those are coming in later versions.

The reason ztop exists is that the existing tools each give you one slice of the picture — `zpool status`, `arc_summary`, `zfs list`, `smartctl` — and you end up running four commands and holding the whole thing in your head. ztop is the dashboard that fuses them. v0.1 is the first slice.

## What v0.1 shows

A single screen that refreshes once a second:

- **ARC size** — current size against `c_max`, as a bar, so you can see at a glance whether the ARC is near its ceiling.
- **Breakdown** — MFU data, MRU data, metadata, and other, both in bytes and as a percentage of the total.
- **Hit ratio** — overall, demand, and prefetch.
- **Throughput** — hits and misses per second.

All of it comes from `/proc/spl/kstat/zfs/arcstats`. No subprocesses, no parsing of human-formatted output, no surprises.

## Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `q` | quit |
| `r` | force refresh |

That's the whole interface in v0.1.

## Requirements

- Linux with OpenZFS installed (the `/proc/spl/kstat/zfs/arcstats` file must exist)
- A terminal that supports ANSI colors and box-drawing characters, which is to say any terminal made in the last 30 years

No runtime dependencies beyond the kernel module being loaded. ztop is a single static binary.

## Roadmap

ztop is a *finishable* project. ZFS is stable, the surface area we care about isn't growing, and once the dashboard shows everything worth seeing there's no v3.0 plugin system to chase. The plan is to ship a few focused versions and then stop.

- **v0.1** — ARC memory visualization (this release)
- **v0.2** — pools view: capacity, fragmentation, health, vdev tree, scrub status
- **v0.3** — datasets view: usage, compression ratios, sortable and filterable
- **v0.4** — snapshots view, with awareness of Sanoid retention classes
- **v0.5** — SMART health joined to vdev members on the pools view

Anything not on this list is explicitly out of scope for v1.0: no remote/fleet mode, no themes, no config files, no JSON export, no alerting. ztop is a local single-host TUI. If you want a fleet view, build it on top — there are better tools for that job and rebuilding Ansible isn't the goal here.

## Why Rust

Because I wanted to see Rust in action on a project I deeply understand. Practically: a static musl binary with no runtime dependencies is the right shape for a system tool that lives on every host you manage, and Rust + ratatui is the cleanest path to that. If this had been Python with Textual it would've been faster to write and harder to ship.
