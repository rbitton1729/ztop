# Build script that runs ON bsd-1 (the FreeBSD CI host) inside a fresh SSH
# session. The GitLab CI job pipes this file to the remote shell:
#
#     ssh gitlab-ci@bsd-1 "REF='${CI_COMMIT_SHA}' VERSION='${CI_COMMIT_TAG#v}' sh -s" \
#         < scripts/bsd-build.sh
#
# Expected env vars:
#
#   REF      — the commit SHA to check out (always set, comes from $CI_COMMIT_SHA)
#   VERSION  — the release version without the "v" prefix, e.g. "0.2.0"
#              (empty on non-tag builds — in which case Cargo.toml is NOT
#              version-stamped, and the build keeps the in-tree "0.0.0-dev")
#
# Builds zftop in release mode and leaves the binary at:
#
#     ~gitlab-ci/zftop/target/release/zftop
#
# The CI job then SCPs that file back into its workspace and continues.
#
# Idempotent — safe to re-run with the same or a different REF.
